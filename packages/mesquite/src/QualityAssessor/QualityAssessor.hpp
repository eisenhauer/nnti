  /*! \class QualityAssessor

      \brief A QualityAssessor instance can be inserted into an 
      InstructionQueue to calculate and summarize registered
      QualityMetric or QualityMetrics for the mesh.

      QualityAssessor provides a summary of the mesh quality.  An 
      instance of QualityAssessor may be inserted in the InstructionQueue
      at any point to print a summary of the mesh quality at that
      time during the optimization.  The application is expected to
      register QualityMetric instances to be used in assessing the
      mesh quality.  If no QualityMetrics are registered, the only
      assessment that will be performed is a simple count of inverted
      elements.

      The "stopping assessor" and "stopping function", if set,
      determinte the value reported to Mesquite for the overall
      run of of the QualityAssessor.
      
      All summary data except the histogram and custom power-means is 
      accumulated for all registered metrics.  QualityAssessment data
      can be obtained through three different mechanisms:
        - QualityAssessor can print a summary to std::out or a specified
          output stream after they are calculated.
        - The get_results and get_all_results methods can be used to
          obtain the sumary data programatically.
        - Quality measures for element-based or vertex-based metrics can
          be stored on the corresponding entities using "tags".
